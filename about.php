                        <p>The Goodtimes Chorus (GTC) is an a cappella chorus based in Arlington, Texas. We are a chapter of the <a href="#" title="">Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS)</a> - formerly known as the S.P.E.B.S.Q.S.A. - in the highly competitive <a href="#" title="">Southwest District of Champions.</a> Founded in 1962, our mission has been to spread good times and the joys of four-part harmony throughout the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. We take great pride in our many awards over the years, and we remain dedicated to continual improvement. It's both lots of fun and lots of hard work, as we strive to be the best we can be.</p>
